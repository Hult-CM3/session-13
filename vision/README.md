### **Image Recognition Agent (Computer Vision)**  
**Concept**: Classify user-uploaded images using a pre-trained CNN.  
**Tech Stack**:  
- **Model**: ResNet, MobileNet (via `torchvision` or `tensorflow`).  
- **Libraries**: `PIL`, `streamlit`.  
**Educational Value**:  
- Teaches convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image preprocessing.  
- Demonstrates transfer learning and model inference.  
**Streamlit Features**: File uploader, image display, real-time predictions.
